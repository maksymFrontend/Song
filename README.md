It provides a convenient and easy way to listen to music on any device, be it a smartphone, tablet or computer. Thanks to "Song" you can enjoy your favorite tracks without limits - create playlists and much more.

The Music player "Song" project used modern technologies, including React, JS, GraphQL, and SCSS. React was chosen as the main tool for creating the user interface due to its high performance and modularity. JavaScript was used for implementing the application's functionality and ensuring interaction between the user and the application. GraphQL was used as the query language for obtaining data about music. SCSS was used for creating a beautiful and scalable application design. As a result of using these technologies, the Music player "Song" became fast, user-friendly, and attractive to users.


In the Music player "Song" project, 'redux-thunk' was used to enable asynchronous interaction with the server and manage the application state, allowing API requests to be made without blocking the user interface. Additionally, 'react-sortable-hoc' was used to implement drag and drop functionality for reordering playlists, allowing users to conveniently rearrange tracks in their playlists, while 'react-dropzone' was used to enable drag and drop file uploading, allowing users to quickly and easily add new tracks to their playlists.
